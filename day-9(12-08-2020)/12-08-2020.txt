Goodmorning to all:
-------------------
Day Objectives:

1.Model Creation
2.ORM(object relational mapping)
3.Model queries(Django shell)











django admin:

->admin can able to create a new user,update existing 
   user and delete existing user

->for admin we have to create a tables
    "python manage.py migrate"

-> to access admin part we have to create superuser
   account

     "python manage.py createsuperuser"




Models:
->in models.py we will create one or more classes
->here each and every class represents a db table
->in this class each field maps a db column
->to convert class into db table we have two commands
    1) python manage.py makemigrations
          ->this command will generate interface file for converting  class to 
             db table
    2) python manage.py migrate
         ->this command will create db tables by using generated 
            interface file


ORM:
----
   by using "object" we can access stored data in database

-> in that we can see  
       1) how to insertion of data
       2) how to access data
       3) how to update and delete data

procedure for model queries:

->open cmd from ur project
->form that location i want to open python shell
->for that cmd you have to import below command 
      "python manage.py shell"
->you have to import your model in django shell
      "from myApp.models import Emp"
  

data inserting:
-------------
1st way:
   obj=Emp(name='value',name1='value1')
   obj.save()
2nd way:
   obj=Emp.objects.create(name='value',name1='value1'....)
   obj



data accessing:
---------------
->if you want to access entire table:
	obj=classname.objects.all()
	obj

-> if you want to access only 2 columns
	obj=classname.objects.values('fn','ln')

->if you want to access specific person data
        1)get-cant allow duplicates
            data=classname.objects.get(pk)(id=)
	2)filter-it returns multiple records
	    data=classname.objects.filter(name='value')
->if you want access first record
            data=classname.objects.first()
->if you want to acess last record in db
	data=classname.objects.last() 
->if you want to retrieve ascending order by first name
	data=classname.objects.order_by('fname')

->if you want to retrieve descending order by first name
	data=classname.objects.order_by('-fname')	
updating:
---------
if you want to update specific field in all records
	info=Emp.objects.all().update(age='45')
	info
if you want to update specific person data

       >you have to fetch data from db
	> then we will update that data
           info=Emp.objects.get(id=3)
           info
           info.lname=''
           info.save()
	   info


deleting:
---------
if you want to delete entire db
> Emp.objects.all.delete()
if you want to delete specific person data
	fetch data from db
         delete record
>info=Emp.objects.get(id=3)
info.delete()
